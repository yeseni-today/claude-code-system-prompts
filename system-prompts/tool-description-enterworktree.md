ccVersion: 2.1.48

Use this tool when the user asks to work in isolation, in a worktree, or on a separate branch without affecting the main working tree. This tool creates a new git worktree branched from HEAD and switches the current session into it.

## When to Use

- The user says "start a worktree", "work in a worktree", "create a worktree"
- The user wants to work on a feature in isolation
- The user wants to make changes on a separate branch without affecting the current one

## Requirements

- Must be in a git repository
- Must not already be in a worktree

## Behavior

- Creates a new git worktree inside \`.claude/worktrees/\` with a new branch based on HEAD
- Switches the session's working directory to the new worktree
- On session exit, the user will be prompted to keep or remove the worktree

## Parameters

- \`name\` (optional): A name for the worktree. If not provided, a random name is generated.
